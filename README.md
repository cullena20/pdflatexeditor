# PDF LaTeX Editor
The PDF LaTeX editor is a simple GUI that allows users to load PDF files as PDfs and to add LaTeX formulas to them. This repository contains a folder with the program and files for the website displaying the project. The tool itself was devised and created soley by David Ugo-Omenukwa. I created the website displaying the project. This was made for the TeenHacks2020 Li Hackathon.
